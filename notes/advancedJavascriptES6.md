My Path: target for this year 2021 is to learn and be comfortable with the follow Advanced Javascript ES6 concepts:

1. Value vs. Reference Variable Assignment
2. Closures
3. Destructuring
4. Spread Syntax/Operator: the '...' appears on the right-hand side of an assignment to expand an array into a list of elements.
5. Rest Syntax (rest parameters) and rest operator.
6. Array Methods (filter, map, reduce, sort)
7. Promises
8. Async Await.

2. Closures:

   -> Closure -> 46m 41s -> This course was released on 01-03-2018 which is prety old and I have checked this out with my Reviewer and been advised it is still worth doing.

In 2020 - 2021 during The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 - Version 2, I have covered Promises, Async/Await. However, it is now Nov 2021 and I am using Pluralsign to refresh my memory on these Javascript concepts: https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/theCompleteJS-Course2020
