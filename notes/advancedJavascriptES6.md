My Path: target for this year 2021 is to learn and be comfortable with the follow Advanced Javascript ES6 concepts:

1. Value vs. Reference Variable Assignment
2. Closures
3. Destructuring
4. Spread Syntax/Operator: the '...' appears on the right-hand side of an assignment to expand an array into a list of elements.
5. Rest Syntax (rest parameters) and rest operator.
6. Array Methods (filter, map, reduce, sort)
7. Promises
8. Async Await.
