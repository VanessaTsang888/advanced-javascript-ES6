4 - Spread Syntax (The Spread Operator):


Spread Operator: x3 periods or dots then the elements -> let nums2 = [â€¦nums1, 4, 5, 6]
Use this syntax instead of concatenate arrays in front of an array or an iterable object where we want to spread elements into its individual components.

The instructor is declaring the variable nums1 with var rather than let or const which is wrong as var is ES5 not ES6.

*/

// When to use the Spread Operator:
// 1 - When we need to add the elements from one array into another array. Example:

window.onload = function () {
  let nums1 = [1, 2, 3];
  let nums2 = [...nums1, 4, 5, 6]; //  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  consol.log(nums2);
};

// 2 - We have a function and want to return the elements inside of the nums array all added up to one single number:

window.onload = function () {
  let nums = [3, 5, 7];
  function addNums(a, b, c) {
    console.log(a + b + c);
  }

  addNums(...nums); // 15
};
